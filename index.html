<h1>Isomorphic Musical Keyboards</h1>

<p>Isomorphic musical keyboards must have been around ever since a lazy pianist decided that transposing between keys on the piano was too hard. Although they look alien to most people, compared to the piano keyboard, any of the isomorphic keyboards make more logical sense. The keyboard that made its furthest inroads into the piano world was the one pattented by Paul von Jank贸 in 1882 of which a fair number of examples can be found on the net. (See <a href="http://squeezehead.com/uniform-keyboard/">this</a>)</p>

<p>In the 20th century proponents of microtonality employed them to build instruments such as the Fokker 31 tone organ. Brian Hayden developed a concertina to use the Wicki system in the 60's that kept all the fingers playing a diatonic scale together. 

<p>But the most popular isomorphic keyboards have to be the ones used on accordions. The Stradella bass system is partly an isomorphic keyboard. On the treble side, the B chromatic system has replaced all other accordion keyboards in Russia and the Balkans, and the C system is widely used in Western Europe. The B system was invented in the 1850's when the Austrian musician Franz Walther had an idea to arrange a row of buttons to match the diminished chord. The Austrian Schrammel accordion was the first to use it. </p>

<p>The fascinating thing is that all these systems can be built on a brick-like lattice with a simple algorithm. The variation between the systems can be boiled down to two parameters: (1) the number of rows required before the pattern repeats and (2) the size of the interval going up one key diagonally.
